# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A little something I came up with and implemented in an hour of the user being able to play rock, paper, scissors with their scores being tracked and an easy way to replay with classes.

Fixed score tallying if a draw was encountered and instead no players get any points as opposed to the system just defaulting to saying the computer won, instead it will say there was a draw.
